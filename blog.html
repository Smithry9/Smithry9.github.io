<h3>Assignment 1 Blog   10/9/2020</h3>
<p>This assignemnt wasn't that difficult for me. It was mostly review for when I used to just try random things in html. I tried doing a little bit of super simple CSS just to change the background color, </p>
<p>but I don't think I'll mess with it much more until the second assignment. I enjoyed getting to make something with an actual purpose in mind, and there was still a bit about page orginazition that I didn't know.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see how this class is going to go, because it seems like it will be really fun and super useful to learn everything. The most useful thing that I used while making this assignment was the lecture notes.</p>
<p>They were really helpful for remembering the syntax and how to structure the website. I'm excited for the next assignments, and especially the last one. </p>
<p>I have no idea what I would want to make for the last one, but I'm still looking forward to it.</p>
