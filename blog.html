    <h3>Assignment 1 Blog   10/9/2020</h3>
    <p>This assignemnt wasn't that difficult for me. It was mostly review for when I used to just try random things in html. I tried doing a little bit of super simple CSS just to change the background color, </p>
    <p>but I don't think I'll mess with it much more until the second assignment. I enjoyed getting to make something with an actual purpose in mind, and there was still a bit about page orginazition that I didn't know.</p>
    <p>I'm excited to see how this class is going to go, because it seems like it will be really fun and super useful to learn everything. The most useful thing that I used while making this assignment was the lecture notes.</p>
    <p>They were really helpful for remembering the syntax and how to structure the website. I'm excited for the next assignments, and especially the last one. </p>
    <p>I have no idea what I would want to make for the last one, but I'm still looking forward to it.</p>
    
    <h3><br>Assignment 2 Blog   10/26/2020</h3>
    <p>This assignment was much more challenging and exciting than the first one. I really learned a lot about CSS and how it can interact with HTML. 
    The assignment looked very intimidating at first but I was able to break it into smaller and easier to manage pieces. It was really cool making a site that looks as good as it does out of just the base HTML.
    I made heavy use of the lecture notes, as well as some CSS documentation I found online to do this assignment. I feel a lot more confortable working with CSS now and am really looking forward to learning how to use javascript
    to make the sites actually functional now. The assignments have been interesting so far and I am looking forward to seeing where they go from here.</p>

    <h3><br>Assignment 3 Blog   11/16/2020</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed this assignment the most so far. It was really cool to watch the Benny's List site evolve as we continue to work on it. 
    I feel like this assignment has given me the most practical skills so far. Javascript is really powerful for working on websites and 
    I'm glad I now know how to apply those skills. I used Javascript documentation and the lecture notes to figure out anything I didn't know how to do.
    I feel a lot more confident with my skills in web development so far and am excited to learn more Javascript on the server side of things.
    Each assignment keeps getting more interesting so I'm really looking forward to learning the new skills related to the next assignments.
    I'm also really excited for the final project, seeing what we can do with javascript really helps me get motivated to learn more.</p>

    <h3><br>Assignment 5 Blog   12/03/2020</h3>
    <p>This assignment was the hardest one so far. I think that the main difficulty came from the fact that we skipped assignment 4. We didn't have a lot of 
    practice using node.js or running a server. However, now that I finished the assignment I feel a lot better about it and enjoyed it a lot. 
    It's really cool to see how to make and run a server and work with more advanced javascript. This assignment has given us the most practical skills so far. 
    I came out of this assignment with a much stronger understanding of how the entirety of a website works. I relied heavily on the lectures about handlebars 
    that were posted to canvas. Without those I would have really been stuck. I'm excited to work with my group and apply the skills that we have learned to make 
    our own website from scratch. I feel like that will be my favorite assignment of the class.</p>
