<h3>Assignment 1 Blog   10/9/2020</h3>
<p>This assignemnt wasn't that difficult for me. It was mostly review for when I used to just try random things in html. I tried doing a little bit of super simple CSS just to change the background color, </p>
<p>but I don't think I'll mess with it much more until the second assignment. I enjoyed getting to make something with an actual purpose in mind, and there was still a bit about page orginazition that I didn't know.</p>
<p>I'm excited to see how this class is going to go, because it seems like it will be really fun and super useful to learn everything. The most useful thing that I used while making this assignment was the lecture notes.</p>
<p>They were really helpful for remembering the syntax and how to structure the website. I'm excited for the next assignments, and especially the last one. </p>
<p>I have no idea what I would want to make for the last one, but I'm still looking forward to it.</p>
    
<h3><br>Assignment 2 Blog   10/26/2020</h3>
<p>This assignment was much more challenging and exciting than the first one. I really learned a lot about CSS and how it can interact with HTML. 
The assignment looked very intimidating at first but I was able to break it into smaller and easier to manage pieces. It was really cool making a site that looks as good as it does out of just the base HTML.
I made heavy use of the lecture notes, as well as some CSS documentation I found online to do this assignment. I feel a lot more confortable working with CSS now and am really looking forward to learning how to use javascript
to make the sites actually functional now. The assignments have been interesting so far and I am looking forward to seeing where they go from here.</p>
