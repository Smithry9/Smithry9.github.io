    <p>Sophomore Computer Science Major</p>
    <p>I have done almost nothing with web development, all I have done is mess around with a little bit of html for fun.</p>
    <p>In this class, I hope to learn how to make legitimately good websites because that is an incredibly useful skill in 2020.</p>
    <p>I have signed up for the Piazza course.</p>
    <p>A interesting fact about me is that I used to perform magic shows at childrens birthday part to raise money to go on a trip for my orchestra class in high school.</p>
